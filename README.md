# AmazonClone
This repositry is my effort to clone amazon website with all its functionality.

The code has been split into two main parts 'server' and 'client'

<h2>Client Side</h2>
The client side code has been initialised by 'create-react-app' command with a number of dependencies the list of which could be found at 'package.json'
The client side consists of the frontend part of the application.

<h2>Server Side</h2>
The server end has been coded with nodejs and express 
'router.js' is the dedicated file containing all the necessary API calls used
